Some notes on how the gallery works:
   -Images are saved by saving the filepath of the image's original location
   -This means that you cannot change the location of the image once you upload it if you want it stay in the gallery
   -I recommend using a central folder for all gallery images in order to prevent this from happening on accident(One is provided if you choose to use it)
